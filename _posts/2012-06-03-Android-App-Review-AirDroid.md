[AirDroid](http://airdroid.com) is a Android app which provides a webinterface to your Android device. The webinterface is accessed through the local WiFi. 

The most useful feature for me is to write Textmessages (SMS) from your Laptop. Another nice feature is to make screenshots and download it directly with the browser. The interface is very well designed and the app is for free.

Screenshot of the webinterface:

Download Airdroid from [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid).
